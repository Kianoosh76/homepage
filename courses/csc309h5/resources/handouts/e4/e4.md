In this week's exercise, you will set up a Next.js project with a Sqlite database and a Prisma ORM. You will implement CRUD APIs that perform data management operations.

Please review the lecture slides for steps to initialize a Sqlite database or a Prisma ORM.

### General notes:

- Before running the auto-tester, test your API handlers using a REST client like Postman to ensure they work correctly.
- Error handling is an important part of APIs. Your code should handle errors gracefully and return a meaningful response with details about what was wrong with the request. Your handler should **never** crash!

## Task 1: Setting Up Prisma and Creating Models

Initialize Prisma in your project using the command: `npx prisma init`. Then, define two models in your `schema.prisma` file: `Author` and `Book`, with fields listed below.

#### Author:

- `id`: Auto-incremented integer, primary key.
- `firstName`: String.
- `lastName`: String.
- `bio`: String, optional.

#### Book:

- `id`: Auto-incremented integer, primary key.
- `title`: String.
- `isbn`: String, unique.
- `publishedDate`: DateTime.
- `available`: Boolean, default to `true`.
- `authorId`: Foreign key linking to the `Author` model.

Define the relationship between `Author` and `Book`:

- Each `Book` should have a reference to an `Author` through the `authorId` field.

After defining the models, run the following command to apply the migration and create the tables in your database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

## Task 2: The "C"

Next, implement the _create_ APIs of your models:

- `POST /api/authors`: An API endpoint to add new authors.
- `POST /api/books`: An API endpoint to add new books, ensuring that each book is linked to an existing author.

### Instructions

- **Creating authors**:

  - The endpoint should accept a JSON request body with the following fields:
    - `firstName`: String (required)
    - `lastName`: String (required)
    - `bio`: String (optional)
  - Use Prisma to insert a new author into the database.

- **Creating books**:
  - The endpoint should accept a request body with the following fields:
    - `title`: String (required)
    - `isbn`: String (required, unique)
    - `publishedDate`: DateTime (required)
    - `available`: Boolean (optional, default to `true`)
    - `authorId`: Integer (required, must reference an existing author)
  - Use Prisma to create a new book in the database, ensuring it is linked to an existing author via the `authorId` field.

### Skeleton Code

```javascript
// pages/api/authors/index.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === "POST") {
    // TODO: Use Prisma to create a new author
  } else {
    res.status(405).json({ message: "Method not allowed" });
  }
}
```

```javascript
// pages/api/books/index.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === "POST") {
    // TODO: Use Prisma to create a new book linked to an existing author
  } else {
    res.status(405).json({ message: "Method not allowed" });
  }
}
```

### Notes:

- Ensure that appropriate error handling is implemented, especially for cases like duplicate ISBNs or non-existent author references.

## Task 3: The "R"

Next, it's time for data retrieval from the database using Prisma. Implement the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/authors`: An API endpoint to retrieve and filter authors.
- `GET /api/books`: An API endpoint to retrieve and filter books.

### Instructions

- **Retrieving and filtering authors**:

  - The endpoint should support the following **optional** query parameters:
    - `id`: Filter authors by their id.
    - `firstName`: Filter authors by their first name (partial match).
    - `lastName`: Filter authors by their last name (partial match).
  - If no filter is provided, return all authors.
  - Use Prisma to apply the filters based on the provided query parameters.

- **Retrieving and filtering books**:
  - The endpoint should support the following **optional** query parameters:
    - `id`: Filter books by their id.
    - `authorId`: Filter books by a specific author.
    - `title`: Filter books by their title (partial match).
    - `available`: Filter books by their availability status (`true` or `false`).
  - For each book, return the information about its author as well (in a field called `author`)
  - If no filter is provided, return all books.
  - Use Prisma to apply the filters based on the provided query parameters.

### Skeleton Code

```javascript
// pages/api/authors/index.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === "POST") {
    // TODO: Use Prisma to create a new author
  } else if (req.method === "GET") {
    // TODO: Use Prisma Client to retrieve and filter authors
  } else {
    res.status(405).json({ message: "Method not allowed" });
  }
}

// pages/api/books/index.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === "POST") {
    // TODO: Use Prisma to create a new book linked to an existing author
  } else if (req.method === "GET") {
    // Use Prisma Client to retrieve and filter books
  } else {
    res.status(405).json({ message: "Method not allowed" });
  }
}
```

### Notes:

- Be careful about the cases where query parameters are invalid and Prisma might throw an exception. Remember that your handler should not crash! If parameters are invalid, a `400 Bad Request` response should be returned instead of a `500 Internal Server Error`

## Task 4: The "U"

Now, it's time to implement update APIs:

- `PUT /api/authors/:id`: an API endpoint to update an author's details.
- `PUT /api/books/:id`: an API endpoint to update a bookâ€™s details.

### Instructions

- **Updating an author**:

  - The endpoint should:
    - Accept a JSON request body with the fields to be updated: `firstName`, `lastName`, `bio`.
    - Update the corresponding author in the database based on the `id` parameter.
    - If some fields are not present, simply don't change their value. That is, if only `firstName` is provided, just update that field in the database.
    - Return the updated author object.

- **Updating a book**:
  - The endpoint should:
    - Accept a JSON request body with the fields to be updated: `title`, `isbn`, `publishedDate`, `available`.
    - Update the corresponding book in the database based on the `id` parameter.
    - If some fields are not present, simply don't change their value. That is, if only `isbn` is provided, just update that field in the database.
    - Return the updated book object.

### Skeleton Code

```javascript
// pages/api/authors/[id].js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === "PUT") {
    const { id } = req.query;

    // TODO: Use Prisma to update the author by ID
  } else {
    res.status(405).json({ message: "Method not allowed" });
  }
}

// pages/api/books/[id].js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === "PUT") {
    const { id } = req.query;

    // TODO: Use Prisma to update the book by ID
  } else {
    res.status(405).json({ message: "Method not allowed" });
  }
}
```

### Notes:

- Ensure that appropriate error handling is implemented, especially for cases where the `id` does not exist or the input data is invalid. If `id` does not exist, return a `404 Not Found` response.

## Task 5: The "D"

Finally, implement the delete operations:

- `DELETE /api/authors/:id`: An API endpoint to delete an author.
- `DELETE /api/books/:id`: An API endpoint to delete a book.

### Instructions

- **Deleting an Author**:

  - The endpoint should delete the corresponding author in the database based on the `id` parameter. Moreover, it should also ensure that when an author is deleted, all associated books are also deleted (cascade delete).
  - Return a success message indicating that the author and their books were deleted.

- **Deleting a Book**:
  - The endpoint should delete the corresponding book in the database based on the `id` parameter.
  - Return a success message indicating that the book was deleted.

### Skeleton Code

```javascript
// pages/api/authors/[id].js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { id } = req.query;

  if (req.method === "PUT") {
    // TODO: Use Prisma to update the author by ID
  } else if (req.method === "DELETE") {
    // TODO: Use Prisma to delete the author by ID and cascade delete their books
  } else {
    res.status(405).json({ message: "Method not allowed" });
  }
}

// pages/api/books/[id].js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { id } = req.query;

  if (req.method === "PUT") {
    // TODO: Use Prisma to update the book by ID
  } else if (req.method === "DELETE") {
    // TODO: Use Prisma to delete the book by ID
  } else {
    res.status(405).json({ message: "Method not allowed" });
  }
}
```

## Submission:

Push your entire Next.js project (excluding `node_modules`) to your git repository for this exercise. Alternatively, you can upload a zip file of your application to Markus as well. If Markus complains about the size of your file, delete `package-lock.json` as well.

**Note**: You should put your files directly under the root directory of your submission. That is, for example, your package file should be at `package.json`, not `next-app/package.json`. The auto-tester will not work if the files are inside a subdirectory.

**Note 2**: Don't forget to include your database schema, migrations, and the sqlite file as well.

**Note 3**: Generally, you should avoid pushing your actual database to git as it is a very bad practice. But in this exercise, we ask you to push the database to ensure consistency between your local auto-tester runs and the one on the Markus server.

## How to run the auto-tester locally

- Run `npm install --save-dev jest supertest`.
- Download the file `api.test.js` from [this link](./e4/api.test.js) and place it anywhere inside your project's directory.
- Run the server (via `npm run dev`) in a separate tab.
- Run `npx jest`.
