In this week's exercise, you will set up authentication and authorization for a Next.js project using JWT token and the `bcrypt` library.

## Task 1: Creating the User Model

First, Define a `User` model in the Prisma schema with the following fields:

- `id`: Auto-incremented integer, primary key.
- `username`: String, unique.
- `password`: String (hashed).
- `role`: String, could be either `ADMIN`, `USER`, default to `USER`.
- `createdAt`: DateTime, default to the current timestamp.

**Note**: In more sophisticated databases (e.g., Postgresql), you would be able to enforce the values of `role` to be only `ADMIN` or `USER` at database-level. However, in sqlite, it's not possible. Therefore, you should define the field as string and enforce the choices at API-level.

Run the Prisma migration to apply the model to your database.

### Hashing Passwords:

- Install the `bcrypt` library to hash user passwords before storing them in the database.
- Install `bcrypt` in your project using the following command:
  ```bash
  npm install bcrypt
  ```
- Modify the user creation logic to hash the password before saving the user to the database.

### The Registration API:

- Implement an API endpoint (`POST /api/users/register`) that allows new users to register.
- The endpoint should accept a `username`, `password`, and `role` in the request body.
- Hash the password using `bcrypt` before saving the user to the database.
- Return a success message or an error if the registration fails (e.g., due to an existing username).

## Task 2: Implementing JWT Authentication

Next, implement an API endpoint (`POST /api/users/login`) that allows users to log in. Keep in mind the following notes about the login endpoint:

- The API should take a `username` and `password` in the request body.
- Validate the credentials by checking the username and comparing the provided password with the hashed password in the database using `bcrypt`.
- If the credentials are valid, generate a JWT using a secret key and include `username`, `role`, and `expiresAt` in the token payload.
- Return the JWT in the response body when the login is successful. It should be in the format of `{"accessToken": ...., "refreshToken": ...}`. Note that both tokens should contain the same payload. Only their secrets are different.
- Typically, the expiration time for the access token should range between 5-60 minutes. For the refresh token, it could be anywhere ranging from a couple of hours, to a day, weeks, etc.
- If the credentials are invalid, return a `401 Unauthorized` response.

### Setting Up JWT:

- Install the `jsonwebtoken` library to handle JWT creation and verification:
  ```bash
  npm install jsonwebtoken
  ```
- Use a secret key to sign the JWTs. Store this secret securely (e.g., in an environment variable).

## Task 3: Protecting Routes with JWT Middleware

In this part, you will implement token verification and protect API routes using JWT middleware.

### Implement Token Verification Middleware:

- Create a function to verify the JWT sent in the `Authorization` header of requests.
- The function should decode the JWT using the secret key and verify its validity.
- If the token is valid, the function returns the token payload (e.g., `username`, `role`).
- If the token is invalid or expired, the function should return `null` or throw an exception.

### Using it as a middleware:

Define a new API route (`GET /api/protected`). Wrap the token verification function around the API handler in a way that it checks for token before executing the actual API handler's logic. If token is not valid, it should return `401 Unauthorized` right away. Otherwise, it should let the API handler run.

This is usually called a `middleware`. That is, a separate logic that applies to various different routes, in order to check permissions, augment request or response, etc.

**Note**: The protected API handler can return any arbitrary JSON object. The auto-tester only checks for the status code of `200 OK`.

**Note 2**: Next.js has [built-in](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware) support for middlewares. However, there are [considerations](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71851464/nextjs-build-failing-because-of-jsonwebtoken-in-middleware-ts) about it, and it will not work with `jsonwebtoken`.

## Task 4: Role-Based Permissions

Now, implement a new protected route (`GET /api/admin/protected`). Update your middleware to only allow users with the `ADMIN` role to access any path that starts with `/api/admin`, otherwise returns `403 Forbidden`. The new protected API can return any object.

## Task 5: Refreshing JWTs

Lastly, it's time to implement the token refresh functionality to extend session duration.

Implement an API endpoint (`POST /api/users/refresh`) that accepts a valid JWT refresh token (`refreshToken`) and returns a new token with an extended expiration. The endpoint should perform the following:

- Verify the validity of the existing token.
- Ensure that the refresh token is not expired.
- Generate a new access token with the same payload (e.g., `username`, `role`) but with a fresh expiration time.
- Return the new access token in the response body.

## Submission:

Push your entire Next.js project (excluding `node_modules`) to your git repository for this exercise. Alternatively, you can upload a zip file of your application to Markus as well. If Markus complains about the size of your file, delete `package-lock.json` as well.

**Note**: that you should put your files directly under the root directory of your submission. That is, for example, your package file should be at `package.json`, not `next-app/package.json`. The auto-tester will not work if the files are inside a subdirectory.

**Note 2**: Don't forget to include your database schema, migrations, and the sqlite file as well.

**Note 3**: Generally, you should avoid pushing your actual database to git as it is a very bad practice. But in this exercise, we ask you to push the database to ensure consistency between your local auto-tester runs and the one on the Markus server.

## How to run the auto-tester locally

- Run `npm install --save-dev jest supertest`.
- Download the file `api.test.js` from [this link](./e6/api.test.js) and place it anywhere inside your project's directory.
- Run the server (via `npm run dev`) in a separate tab.
- Run `npx jest`.
