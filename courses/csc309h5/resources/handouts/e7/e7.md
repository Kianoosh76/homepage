## Multi-Purpose Converter

In this week's lecture, we implemented a two-way Celsius to Fahrenheit converter. In this exercise, you are to extend that converter to include more types and units.

First, the user selects the conversion type from a dropdown, and then type values in either of input boxes. The value of the other box should be adjusted in real-time. At the end it, it will be (somewhat) similar to the converter on Google search, and more similar to the this picture: ![Extended Converter](./e7/e7.png)

## Task 1: Choose Conversion Types

- Allow conversions between the following categories:
  - **Length:** Meters to Feet, and Feet to Meters.
  - **Weight:** Kilograms to Pounds, and Pounds to Kilograms.
  - **Temperature:** Fahrenheit to Celsius, Celsius to Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
  - **Area:** Square Meters to Square Feet, and Square Feet to Square Meters.

## Task 2: Dropdown for Conversion Type

- Display a dropdown menu at the top of the component to select the conversion type (Length, Weight, Temperature, Area).
- Assign `id="conversion-type"` to this dropdown for auto-testing.
- When the conversion type is changed, all input fields and unit dropdowns should be cleared automatically.

## Task 3: Dropdowns for Unit Selection

- Display two dropdown menus, each next to an input field, to select the units for conversion.
- Assign the following attributes to these dropdowns for auto-testing:
  - `id="lhs-unit"` for the first dropdown (left-hand-side unit).
  - `id="rhs-unit"` for the second dropdown (right-hand-side unit).
- When a user selects a unit in one dropdown, the selected unit in the other dropdown should automatically adjust to be different than it.
- Each dropdown should have a default value, such as "Meters" for Length or "Celsius" for Temperature.

## Task 4: Implement Conversion Logic

- Implement the logic for converting between the selected units.
- Assign `id="lhs-input"` to the left-hand-side field.
- Assign `id="rhs-input"` to the right-hand-side field.
- When a user inputs a value in one unit, automatically calculate and display the corresponding value in the other unit.
- Note that the user should be able to enter or edit values in either of the boxes.

## Task 5: Automatic Clearing on Type Change

- Ensure that changing the conversion type clears all inputs and resets the dropdowns to their default values.

## Submission

Only submit `index.html`. This file should contain all your logic (i.e., HTML and JSX), as well as all relevant imports. You can download the lecture code from the course website and use it as a starter code.

## How to run the auto-tester locally

- Move your HTML file to an empty directory.
- Download `e7-tester.js` from [this link](./e7/e7-tester.js) and place it next to your HTML file.
- Inside that directory, run `npm init`.
- Then, run `npm install puppeteer`.
- Finally, run `node e7-tester.js`.
