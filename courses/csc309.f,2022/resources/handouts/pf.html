                                to your backend server. The deliverable is a fully-functional
                                website that is shippable, presentable, self-explanatory,
                                smooth, and beautiful.

                                <li>The interviews will simulate the real-world delivery of your application to the
                                    business owner. That is, the business owner is looking for a <b>complete website</b>
                                    that has a <b>very smooth and bug-free UX</b> and a <b>beautiful UI</b>. Pay utmost
                                    attention to the UX, where users should be able to navigate around without any
                                    problem or any need for instructions from someone else. You certainly remember
                                    websites that you left before a minute because you could not find a page you where
                                    looking for, or parts of a button was not clickable because of a simple frontend
                                    bug. You certainly did not have any empathy for the potentially countless hours the
                                    backend and frontend engineers spent on building that website and whether other
                                    parts worked well or not. You left the website, and that was the loss of a potential
                                    customer for that business. </li>
                                <li>In our interviews, we will not be as harsh as mentioned above, but you should expect
                                    that the marking scheme is different from a classic project where the only important
                                    thing is that the code somehow <i>works</i>. You will lose marks is your website is
                                    incomplete (lacks some functionalities) or has major or minor UI/UX issues. Smooth
                                    UX is also about single-page experience, front-end validations, in-place
                                    error-handling, asynchronous requests, and clean re-renders; all of which offered by
                                    React.</li>
                                <li>This course is not about UI design; so you can freely choose any UI templates that
                                    is available outside. However, you must adhere to the common sense when it comes to
                                    your UI. Your UI must give a good first impression to users. Exploring your website
                                    should be delightful for users. A basic UI that everyone can tell it is the default
                                    of a framework (e.g., bootstrap) is <b>not</b> delightful to explore.</li>
                                <li>Your website should include pages. That is, even though you are building a
                                    single-page application, you should change the browser's URL accordingly so that
                                    users will be able to navigate through different places with the back/forward button
                                    or re-visit a specific page through its URL. Please refer to lecture 11 to find out
                                    about pages in React.</li>
                                <li>Different sections of your website must be reachable by a navigation bar. A user
                                    dropdown to see/edit profile, manage subscriptions, and logout is also required. The
                                    user must <b>never</b> need to manually change the URL (except for accessing the
                                    admin panel). Besides those requirements, the exact content of pages and the choice
                                    of first page (or landing page) is up to you. We recommend that your first page
                                    includes the search functionality, and also includes (or links) to the subscription
                                    plans. </li>

                            <div class="blog_subtitle"><b>Pre-populated database</b></div>

                            <p>Unlike last part, you should push your database/media files to your repository.
                                The reason is pre-existing data improves your presentation a lot. The business owner
                                certainly does not want to navigate a blank website that contains only a couple of
                                studios. To showcase your project, it is suggested that you include at least 10-20
                                studios with their full information (location, classes, images, amenities, coaches,
                                etc.)
                                Obviously, your strings, images, phone numbers, etc. cannot be random sequences of
                                characters/bytes. You can enter data manually, or use online datasets (recommended), or
                                even crawl similar websites.</p>

                            <p><b>Note 1</b>: The data does not have to be original or genuine. For example, if you show
                                the phone number (647) 643-6710, it does not have to be a real phone number associated
                                with a gym. However, a blank number or something like (111) 111-1111 is obviously
                                unacceptable.</p>

                            <p><b>Note 2</b>: Make sure that your database/media is not too big that it would take a lot
                                of time to clone/load.</p>

                            <div class="blog_subtitle"><b>Pagination</b></div>

                            <p>As mentioned in part 1 handout, every API that returns a list of objects should be
                                paginated. (e.g., list of studios, upcoming class schedule, past payments). However,
                                depending on your database size, you should choose your page size so that the TA can
                                test that you implemented pagination correctly. For example, a page size of 200 when you
                                only have 100 gyms means that the TA should create 100 new studios to check this
                                feature, which is impossible. You can implement pagination via regular buttons (like
                                google search on Desktops) or through infinite scrolls. Also, different endpoints can
                                have different page sizes.</p>

                            <div class="blog_subtitle"><b>What to submit</b></div>

                            <p>You must push both your frontend and backend servers to your repository. Push two scripts
                                as well: startup.sh and run.sh. The <b>startup</b> script should run all preparations
                                such as creating the virtual env, pip installing all packages, migrations, npm install,
                                etc. The <b>run</b> script should run both backend and frontend servers. The TA will
                                clone your application and work with your frontend interface like an ordinary user and
                                will check all the required features. It should be a fully-functional website where
                                users interact without any help from other people. This time, there is no need for
                                pushing documentation or Postman collections.</p>

                            <p><b>Note 1</b>: You can very make any improvements you want to your submissions for the
                                previous phases. You can even write them from scratch (not recommended because there is
                                not that much time). We will not look at what you submitted for those phases and will
                                only assess the files under the PF folder.</p>

                            <p><b>Note 2</b>: Before submitting, make sure that your startup and run scripts work well
                                on the virtual machines given to you. The TAs will run your application on clean
                                instances of that virtual machine. If you have worked with another operating system, it
                                is your absolute responsibility to double-check that your project works fine within the
                                virtual machine as well.</p>
