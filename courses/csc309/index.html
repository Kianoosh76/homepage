													<p>An introduction to software development on the web. The course covers the development of
														programs
														that operate on the web and survey of technological alternatives, with emphasis on modern
														web
														development technologies. Concepts, including the internet and the web, static client
														content, dynamic
														client content, dynamically served content, data management, web development processes,
														deployment, and containerization are discussed. It features a comprehensive project for
														students to showcase their understanding over the course content.

												<div class="tab_panel_text">
													<p>This course is suitable for anyone interested in learning web programming and may be
														seeking a relevant job in the future. It assumes no prior knowledge or experience in web
														development. Concepts will be discussed from the very basics. However, the focus will be on
														practical and up-to-date technologies.

											<div class="tab_panel_section">
												<div class="tab_panel_title">Assessment</div>
												<div class="tab_panel_text">
													<p>Assessment will be done through weekly exercises, a project, and exams. Each one is
														described in
														detail below.</p>
												</div>
												<br>
												<div class="tab_panel_subtitle">Weekly exercises</div>
												<div class="tab_panel_text">
													<p>
														Every week, you will be given a handful of small problems related to the topics discussed at
														the lecture. The exercises are designed to help you understand the concepts better and gain
														practical experience. Due to the educational nature of the exercises, the auto-grader will
														be provided to you, so you can check your answers before submission.
													</p>
													<p>
														You should submit your solutions to Markus every <b>Thursday</b> by <b>3pm</b>. Note that
														because of the
														number of exercises, their relatively low impact on your final grade, and the availability
														of the auto-grader, no late submissions, extensions, or remark requests will be
														accommodated. Your best 9 out of 11 submissions will count for grading.
													</p>
													<p>
														Keep in mind that the exercises are meant to give you some initial practice with the topics.
														Therefore, it is important to do them yourself and understand the solutions. It will be
														possible to
														satisfy the
														auto-grader without fully developing the solution. But grading is not the purpose of the
														exercises, and it might impact your ability to do the project or exams.
													</p>
												</div>
												<br>
												<div class="tab_panel_subtitle">Project</div>
												<div class="tab_panel_text">
													<p>
														The project simulates a real-world web application that you might be asked to
														develop as a freelance web developer. Even though the scope is small, it is designed to give
														a sense
														of what creating a real website and working as a full-stack developer would entail. For
														the
														project, you can form groups of 2 or 3 members. You can also do it alone,
														but it is not recommended as the workload is excessive for one person. The topic of the
														project is an online code execution platform. Details will be provided once the project
														handout is released.
													</p>
													<p>
														You will deliver the project in two parts. In part 1, you will deliver the backend of the
														application. In part 2, you will develop the frontend, connect the backend to it, and
														deliver the full web application.
													</p>
													<p>
														Grading will take place through interview sessions with TAs. They will work with your
														website to check if the requirements are implemented correctly. Also, they will ask each
														member questions about their role and the code they have written.
														The grade for the former will be shared among all members, while the latter will yield
														individual grades based on each member's participation and understanding of the entire
														submission.
													</p>
												</div>
												<br>
												<div class="tab_panel_subtitle">Examination</div>
												<div class="tab_panel_text">
													<p>
														There will be a midterm exam during week 5 of the lectures, as well as a final exam at the
														end
														of the semester. The exams will be held in person and will be closed-book. However, you will
														be allowed
														to bring one letter-sized paper with <b>hand-written notes</b> on both sides. Note that
														printed or
														typed notes are not allowed. The exams are designed
														to test your understanding of the concepts, architectures, and practices discussed in the
														course. There will not be any questions about specific syntax, commands, function
														names, etc.

															Note that the final exam is cumulative and will cover all the topics discussed in

											<div class="tab_panel_section">
												<div class="tab_panel_title">Late submissions</div>

														No late submissions will be accepted for the weekly exercises. For the project, late
														submissions will be accepted with a penalty of 10% per day, up to a maximum of three days
														late.
													</p>
													<p>
														If you are registered with Accessibility Services, you might be entitled to extensions on
														the project deadlines. In that case, email the instructor (via the course-related email) at
														least
														one week before the deadline and request the extension. Note that individual entitlements
														will be adjusted to the size of the team. For example, if one member of a team of two is
														entitled to 7 days of extensions, the team will be granted ⌈7/2⌉=4 days.

														No remark requests will be accepted for the weekly exercises. For the project, you may
														request a remark for the interview part of the grading. However, the request must be
														submitted within <b>three days</b> of receiving your grade through Markus or by email to the
														instructor or the lead TA. You must point out specific grading errors
														in your request, and the entire group must agree to it. Keep in mind that your
														entire work will be re-evaluated, and your grade may increase, decrease, or remain the same.

												<div class="tab_panel_text">
													<p>
														To request special consideration, bring supporting documentation to the instructor in person
														during office hours at least one week in advance of the due date.
													</p>
													<p>
														In the event of illness or another unforeseen event, please contact the instructor (via the
														course-related email) and provide
														supporting documentation within one week of the missed work. You must also declare your
														absence on Acorn. Do not wait until the due date has passed. It is always easier to make
														alternate arrangements before the due date.

												<div class="tab_panel_text">
													<p>

														Honesty and fairness are fundamental to the University of Toronto’s mission. Plagiarism is a
														form of academic fraud and is treated very seriously.

														You are also expected to read the handout
														<a href="http://www.writing.utoronto.ca/advice/using-sources/how-not-to-plagiarize">How Not
															to Plagiarize</a>
														and to be familiar with the <a

															of Behavior on Academic Matters</a>.
													</p>
													<p>
														You are allowed to search the internet, use online resources, open-source
														codes, and generative
														AI (e.g., ChatGPT) to help you with the project.
														However, sharing even a small
														piece of code with other teams is strictly prohibited (whether giving or receiving).
													</p>
													<p>
														Note that All work that was not written by you or your teammates must be cited in the code,
														including open-source codes and code created by generative AI.
