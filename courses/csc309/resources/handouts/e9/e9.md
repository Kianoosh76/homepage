This week, you'll focus on TailwindCSS. Start a new Next.js project and install and configure Tailwind. Note that every task should be implemented on its own URL path.

## Task 1: Responsive grid with TailwindCSS

In this task, you will create a responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS that adapts to different screen sizes.

### Steps:

- The page at `/grid` should contain a container with `id="grid"` includes a grid of cards, where each card represents an item (such as a product). Display at least 8 cards there.
- The grid should adjust based on the screen size:
  - On small screens, display 1 column.
  - On medium screens, display 2 columns.
  - On large screens, display 4 columns.
- Each card should contain:
  - An image (`<img>` tag with `alt` attribute) with the class `card-image`.
  - A title (`<h2>` tag) with the class `card-title`.
  - A description (`<p>` tag) with the class `card-description`.
- Use Tailwind CSS classes to style the cards with:
  - A white background
  - A solid border of 2px.
  - Rounded corners of 0.5rem.
  - A large shadow
  - Padding of 1rem.
  - Hover effects to increase the shadow on hover
- Use Tailwind units, not the numbers provided above.
- Assign each card a `class="card"` for auto-grader reference.

Your page will look like similar to the following pictures in small, medium, and large screens, respectively.

## Task 2: Flex Layout with Tailwind CSS

Now, it's time to create flexible and responsive layouts using Tailwind.

### Steps

- The page at `/flex` should contain a responsive navigation bar with `id="navbar"` that includes:
  - A logo on the left side.
  - Navigation links with `id="nav-links"` on the right side.
- On small screens, hide the navigation links and replace them with a [hamburger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button) menu icon (with `id="hamburger-menu"`).
- When the hamburger icon is clicked, display the navigation links as a vertical list (with `id="nav-links-sm"`).
- Below the navigation bar, create a hero section with `id="hero-section"`:
  - A full-width background image.
  - A heading (`<h1>` tag) with the class `hero-title`.
  - A call-to-action button with the class `hero-button`.
- The hero section must remains centered and responsive at different screen sizes.
- Hint: Use Tailwind and Flexbox classes (`flex`, `hidden`, `block`, `justify-center`, `items-center`) appropriately.

Your page will look like similar to the following pictures in small, and bigger screens, respectively.

## Task 3: A responsive, multi-section page

Finally, you will apply Tailwind CSS classes to create a fully responsive multi-section webpage using grid, flexbox, and responsive design principles.

### Designing the layout

- The page at `/` should contain the following sections:
  - **Header:** A header containing the site's logo and a navigation bar.
  - **Main Content:** A main section divided into multiple subsections (e.g., authors, stores, books).
  - **Footer:** A footer with contact information and social media links.

### Creating the header

- In the header (`id="header"`), include:
  - A logo on the left.
  - Navigation links on the right (with `id="nav-links"`).
- Use Tailwind's `flex`, `justify-between`, and `items-center` classes to align the logo and navigation links.
- Similar to the previous task, on small screens, a "hamburger" menu should be shown instead of the navigation links (with `id="hamburger-menu"`). Clicking on it should display the navigation links vertically (with `id="nav-links-sm"`).

### Building the main content

- In the main content section (`id="main-content"`), create multiple subsections:
  - **Authors Section:** Displayed using a grid layout
  - **Stores Section:** Display stores items using a grid or flexbox layout.
  - **Books Section:** Arrange books in a responsive layout.

### Implementing the footer

- In the footer (`id="footer"`), include:
  - Contact information on the left.
  - Social media links on the right.
- Footer should be responsive, with content stacking vertically on smaller screens.

Your page will look like similar to the following pictures in small, medium, and large screens, respectively.

## Submission:

Push your entire Next.js project (excluding `node_modules`) to your git repository for this exercise. Alternatively, you can upload a zip file of your application to Markus as well. If Markus complains about the size of your file, delete `package-lock.json` as well.

Note that you should put your files directly under the root directory of your submission. That is, for example, your package file should be at `package.json`, not `next-app/package.json`. The auto-tester will not work if the files are inside a subdirectory.

## How to run the auto-tester locally

- Run `npm install --save-dev jest puppeteer`.
- Download `frontend.test.js` from [this link](./e9/frontend.test.js) and place it anywhere inside your project's directory.
- Run `npx jest`.
- The tests are designed to finish within 3-4 seconds. If your internet connection is slow, it might take longer. See [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72563567/1892185) on instructions for increasing the deadline. Note that timeouts are actually signs of bugs in most cases. Also note that the increase will only happen locally, not on Markus.
