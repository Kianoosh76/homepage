This week, you will deploy a simple Next.js application to the internet! There's nothing more exciting that in software engineering, is there?

You can deploy to either Vercel or a cloud-based virtual machine (e.g., AWS ec2), or even both (if you are curious to compare the differences between these systems).

Both options provide free plans. **Do not go with a paid option!**

You can choose to deploy any of the previous assignments, or start a new project from scratch.

The auto-tester will fetch `/csc309-e11`, where your app should return an HTML response that contains a div with `id="auto-tester"` and exactly the following content (replace `__utorid__` with your actual UTorID):

```html
<div id="auto-tester">
  Hi. I am __utorid__, and I have learned how to develop a full-stack web app
  and deploy it!
</div>
```

## Submission

This time, you will not submit your project to Markus. It's already on the internet!

Instead, only submit one JavaScript file (named `scripts.js`) that implements the following two functions:

```javascript
function getBaseUrl() {
  // return the base URL of your deployed app (only the protocol + domain)
}

function getUtorId() {
  // return your UTorId
}

module.exports = {
  getBaseUrl,
  getUtorId,
};
```

**Note**: Your app should serve on port 80. The auto-tester will not accept other ports.

## How to run the auto-tester locally

- Download `e11-tester.js` from [this link](./e11/e11-tester.js) and place it next to your script file (`scripts.js`).
- Run `node e11-tester`.
