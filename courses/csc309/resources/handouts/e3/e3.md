In this week's exercise, you'll set up a Next.js project and implement the requested API routes. Your server should run on port 3000.

## Task 1: Basic API Routes

Create two new API routes in your Next.js project:

- `/api/greet`: Return a JSON object with a greeting message, e.g., `{ "message": "Hello, world!" }`.
- `/api/text-response`: Return a plain text response, e.g., `Hello, this is a plain text response.`
- Optional: Think about which of them adheres to the REST framework's standard?

## Task 2: Dynamic HTML API

Implement a new API route `/api/html-greet`: This route should accept a query parameter `name`. If the `name` parameter is provided (e.g., `/api/html-greet?name=John`), return a personalized HTML response, e.g.,

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, John!</h1>
    <p>This is a personalized HTML response.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

If no query parameter is provided, return a default response:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a default HTML response.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Task 3: POST Requests

Implement a new API route `/api/personalize`: This route should accept a POST request with a JSON body containing multiple properties:

- `name`: The person's name.
- `age`: The person's age.
- `preferences`: An object with at least two properties, e.g., `color` and `hobby`.

The API should perform the following tasks:

- Validate the data: Ensure `name` is a string, `age` is a number, and `preferences` is an object with the required properties.
- If validation fails, return a meaningful error message for the invalid field. (e.g., `{"error": "name is required"}`)
- If validation succeeds, return a personalized JSON response that includes:

  - A greeting message that uses the `name`.
  - A message about their age, e.g., `"You're 25 years old."`
  - A message that reflects their preferences, e.g., `"Your favorite color is blue and you enjoy painting."`

- Additionally, if the user's `age` is over 18, the response includes an extra message, e.g., `"You're eligible for our special offers!"`

Example JSON request body:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25,
  "preferences": {
    "color": "blue",
    "hobby": "painting"
  }
}
```

## Task 4: Dynamic Routes

Implement a dynamic API route `/api/posts/[id]` (read [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) for more info): This route should perform the following tasks:

- **Simulate a database**: Create an relatively large array of objects (at least 20 elements) with properties `id`, `title`, `content`, `author`, `createdAt`, and `tags`.
- **Fetch and return post data**: Based on the `id` provided in the URL, return the corresponding post's data, including all its properties.
- **Handle missing posts**: If a post with the given `id` doesn't exist, return a 404 error with a JSON message, e.g., `{ "error": "Post not found" }`.
- **Note**: Before running the auto-tester, use the below data as your simulated database. The auto tester has no idea of your own database!

### Example Data Structure:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Learning JavaScript",
    "content": "JavaScript is a versatile language...",
    "author": "John Doe",
    "createdAt": "2024-08-15T08:00:00Z",
    "tags": ["javascript", "programming"]
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Understanding React",
    "content": "React is a powerful library for building UIs...",
    "author": "Jane Smith",
    "createdAt": "2024-08-16T09:00:00Z",
    "tags": ["react", "javascript"]
  }
]
```

### Example Requests and Responses:

- /api/posts/1 should return the full data for the post with id 1 (as a JSON object).
- /api/posts/3 should return a 404 error if no post with id 3 exists.

## Task 5: Filtering and pagination

Implement `/api/posts`:This route should perform the following tasks:

- **Simulate a database**: Use the same data structure from the previous task.
- **Implement filtering by tags**: Add optional query parameters to filter posts by `tags`. For example, if a request is made to `/api/posts?tags=javascript,react`, only return the post if its `tags` array includes both "javascript" and "react".
- **Pagination**: Add support for pagination with query parameters like `page` and `limit`. For example, `/api/posts?page=2&limit=5` should return the second set of five posts.
- **Output format**: Output a JSON array, where each element is the full data for a matching post.
- **Note**: Before running the auto-tester, use the previous task's data as your simulated database. The auto tester has no idea of your own database!

## Submission

Push your entire Next.js app to the git repo for this exercise (without `node_modules` of course!). Alternatively, you can upload a zip file of your application to Markus as well. If Markus complains about the size of your file, delete `package-lock.json` as well.

Note that you should put your files directly under the root directory of your submission. That is, for example, your package file should be at `package.json`, not `next-app/package.json`. The auto-tester will not work if the files are inside a subdirectory.

## How to run the auto-tester locally

- Run `npm install --save-dev jest supertest`.
- Download the file `api.test.js` from [this link](./e3/api.test.js) and place it anywhere inside your project's directory.
- Run `npx jest`.
