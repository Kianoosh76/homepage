This week, you will deploy a simple serverless application! That is, you will just write a small function, and it will get automatically deployed!

All major cloud providers offer serverless application. Examples are Amazon Lambda and Google Cloud Functions. Both options provide free plans. **Do not go with a paid option!**

Write a simple cloud function that returns the following text (replace `__utorid__` with your actual UTorID):

```
Hi. I am __utorid__, and I have learned how to deploy a severless app!
```

## Submission

This time, you will not submit your project to Markus. It's hosted on the cloud!

Instead, only submit one JavaScript file (named `scripts.js`) that implements the following two functions:

```javascript
function getAppUrl() {
  // return the URL of your deployed serverless app.
}

function getUtorId() {
  // return your UTorId
}

module.exports = {
  getAppUrl,
  getUtorId,
};
```

## How to run the auto-tester locally

- Download `e10-tester.js` from [this link](./e10/e10-tester.js) and place it next to your script file (`scripts.js`).
- Run `node e10-tester`.
