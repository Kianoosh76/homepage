## Task 1: Build Your Personal Web Profile

In this task, you will create an HTML page that serves as your personal web profile. Your profile should include the following elements:

1. **Header:**

   - Use a `<header>` element to display the title of your page. The title should be your name, styled as a level 1 heading (`<h1>`).
   - Add a navigation menu with links (`<a>`) to three different sections of the page: "About Me", "Hobbies", and "Contact". These sections should correspond to the content below.

2. **About Me Section:**

   - Create a section (`<section>`) with the ID `about` that includes a brief paragraph (`<p>`) introducing yourself. Mention your name, background, and one interesting fact about yourself.

3. **Hobbies Section:**

   - Create another section with the ID `hobbies`. Inside this section, include an unordered list (`<ul>`) of at least three of your favorite hobbies. Each hobby should be an item (`<li>`) in the list, and you should briefly describe each one.

4. **Contact Section:**

   - Create a section with the ID `contact` at the bottom of the page. This section should contain a footer (`<footer>`) with your contact information. Include an email link using the `mailto:` attribute. Also, include a small form with
     name, email, and message for people who do not want to contact you via email. The form does not have to actually send the data to anywhere.

5. **Footer:**
   - In the footer, add a small copyright notice. Use an HTML entity to represent the copyright symbol (e.g., `&copy; 2024 [Your Name]`).

## Guidelines:

- Your HTML document should begin with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and have a `<head>` section with a title (`<title>`), meta tags for character set and viewport settings, and any other relevant metadata.
- Ensure that all elements are properly nested and follow best practices for HTML structure.
- Use semantic HTML5 elements where appropriate (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
- The navigation links in the header should use `href` attributes that reference the IDs of the corresponding sections.
- Your web page will look like similar to this picture: ![T1 screenshot](./e1/e1-t1.png)

## Task 2: Style Your Personal Web Profile

You, you will enhance the HTML page you created in Task 1 by applying CSS to improve its visual appearance. To achieve that, create an external CSS file, link it to your HTML document, and use it to style various elements of your personal web profile.

1. **Link an External CSS File:**

   - Create a new CSS file named `styles.css` and link it to your HTML document within the `<head>` section.

2. **Page Background and Font:**

   - Set a background color for the entire page.
   - Choose a font for the page content that differs from the default. Use a web-safe font or a Google Font if you wish.

3. **Header Styling:**

   - Center the header text (`<h1>`) on the page.
   - Set the font size of the header to be larger than the body text and change its color.

4. **Navigation Menu:**

   - Style the navigation links (`<nav> <a>`) to remove the underline.
   - Change the color of the navigation links.
   - Add a hover effect that changes the color or background of the links when the user hovers over them.

5. **Sections Styling:**

   - Add padding and margin to the sections (`<section>`) to create space between the content and the edges of the sections.
   - Use a different background color for each section to visually separate them.

6. **List Styling:**

   - Customize the list items (`<li>`) under the Hobbies section to have the italic font style and color.
   - Add a border or a background color to each list item.

7. **Contact Styling:**

   - Customize the contact form by making the input boxes bigger and better spaced from the label.

8. **Footer Styling:**
   - Center the footer text and adjust its font size to be smaller than the body text.
   - Set the footer background color to match the page’s overall theme.

## Guidelines:

- All your CSS should be written in the external `styles.css` file.
- Your CSS file should be linked correctly in the `<head>` section of your HTML document.
- Use meaningful class or ID names in your HTML to apply styles effectively.
- Your web page will look like similar to this picture: ![T1 screenshot](./e1/e1-t2.png)

## Submission:

- Save your CSS file as `styles.css` and ensure it’s correctly linked to your `index.html`. Submit both files. File names should exactly be the same as outlines in this handout.
- Use the auto-grader to check your work after submitting your work on Markus.

## Running the auto-tester:

You do not need to run the auto-tester locally. You can simply submit your code to Markus and run the tests there. However, if you do want to run them locally, follow these steps:

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) on your computer.
- Move `index.html` and `styles.css` to an empty directory
- Download `e1-tester.js` from [this link](./e1/e1-tester.js) and move it to the same directory, next to the html and css files.
- Inside that directory, run `npm init`.
- Then, run `npm install cheerio puppeteer`.
- Finally, run `node e1-tester.js`.

Don't be scared of these instructions! We will discuss them in detail as soon as Week 3 of the lectures. So until then, thanks for your patience!
