## Task 1: JavaScript syntax and logic

In this task, you will solve general programming problems using JavaScript. This task is designed to increase your familiarity with the JS syntax. You can run the codes in a browser (e.g., blank page), on an online JS edit, or even via the Node runtime. For submission, just put together all your functions in a file, **export** them, and submit it to Markus. More information about exporting will follow in below sections.

### 1. Flatten a Nested Array

Write a function `flattenArray(nestedArray)` that takes a nested array of arrays and returns a flattened version of the array. Avoid using built-in `flat()` or `flatMap()` methods.

**Example:**

```javascript
console.log(flattenArray([1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]])); // Should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### 2. Group an Array of Objects by a Property

Write a function `groupBy(arr, property)` that takes an array of objects and a property name, then groups the objects by that property. The function should return an object where the keys are the unique property values, and the corresponding values are arrays containing the objects that have that property value.

#### Example:

```javascript
const people = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 21 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 21 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 22 },
];

console.log(groupBy(people, "age"));
// Should print:
// {
//   '21': [{ name: 'Alice', age: 21 }, { name: 'Bob', age: 21 }],
//   '22': [{ name: 'Charlie', age: 22 }]
// }
```

### 3. Memoization Function

Write a function `memoize(fn)` that takes a function `fn` as an argument and returns a new memoized version of that function. The memoized function should cache the results based on the input arguments and return the cached result if the function is called again with the same arguments.

Memoization is a technique used to optimize functions by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing those results when the same inputs occur again.

#### Example:

```javascript
const slowFunction = (num) => {
  // Simulate a slow computation
  for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) {}
  return num * 2;
};

const memoizedFunction = memoize(slowFunction);

console.log(memoizedFunction(5)); // Should compute and return 10
console.log(memoizedFunction(5)); // Should return cached result: 10
console.log(memoizedFunction(10)); // Should compute and return 20
```

### 4. Sum of Nested Object Values

Write a function `sumNestedValues(obj)` that takes an object with nested objects and returns the sum of all numeric values found within the object, regardless of depth.

The function should recursively traverse the object to find and sum all numeric values, including those in nested objects.

#### Example:

```javascript
const data = {
  a: 1,
  b: { c: 2, d: 3 },
  e: { f: { g: 4 } },
};

console.log(sumNestedValues(data)); // Should print 10
```

### 5. Pagination Function

Implement a function `paginateArray(arr, pageSize, pageNumber)` that takes an array of items, a page size, and a page number, then returns the items for that specific page. The function should also handle cases where the requested page is out of bounds.

Pagination is a common technique used in applications to divide content into manageable chunks, allowing users to navigate through content page by page.

#### Example:

```javascript
const items = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"];

console.log(paginateArray(items, 2, 1)); // Should print ['a', 'b']
console.log(paginateArray(items, 2, 2)); // Should print ['c', 'd']
console.log(paginateArray(items, 2, 3)); // Should print ['e', 'f']
console.log(paginateArray(items, 2, 4)); // Should print []
```

### 6. Event Emitter

Create a simple `EventEmitter` class that allows registering event handlers and emitting events with data. The class should support two main methods:

- `.on(event, handler)`: Registers a handler function to be called whenever the specified event is emitted.
- `.emit(event, data)`: Calls all handler functions registered for the specified event, passing them the provided data.

Event emitters are a fundamental pattern in JavaScript, particularly in building event-driven systems where different parts of an application need to communicate with each other.

#### Example:

```javascript
class EventEmitter {
  // Your code here
}

const emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.on("greet", (name) => console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`));
emitter.emit("greet", "Alice"); // Should print 'Hello, Alice!'
```

### 7. First Non-Repeating Character

Write a function `firstNonRepeatingChar(str)` that takes a string and returns the first character that does not repeat. If all characters repeat or the string is empty, return `null`.

This problem challenges you to efficiently identify the first unique character in a string, considering both space and time complexity.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(firstNonRepeatingChar("swiss")); // Should print 'w'
console.log(firstNonRepeatingChar("racecar")); // Should print 'e'
console.log(firstNonRepeatingChar("aabbcc")); // Should print null
```

### Important note

Do not forget to put the following lines at the end of your file so that your functions are **exported**. Otherwise, the auto tester will not work

```javascript
module.exports = {
  flattenArray,
  groupBy,
  memoize,
  sumNestedValues,
  paginateArray,
  EventEmitter,
  firstNonRepeatingChar,
};
```

#### Guidelines

- It's recommended that your code is clean, well-structured, and properly commented where necessary.
- Each function should be self-contained and solve the problem as described.
- Think about edge cases in your implementation, such as empty arrays or invalid inputs.
- Think about error handling. Will your functions handle errors gracefully (i.e., return meaningful results even in unexpected scenarios)?

## Submission

- Submit your solutions as a single JavaScript file with correctly named functions corresponding to each problem.
- Name your file `task1.js`.
- Note that, **exceptionally**, in this exercise, you will submit the files for tasks 1 and 2 separately. Submit this task's file under the corresponding task on Markus.

## How to run the auto-tester locally

You do not need to run the auto-tester locally. You can simply submit your code to Markus and run the tests there. However, if you do want to run them locally, follow these steps:

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) on your computer.
- Download `e2-t1-tester.js` from [this link](./e2/e2-t1-tester.js) and place it next to your script file (`task1.js`).
- Run `node e2-t1-tester`.

Don't be scared of these instructions! We will discuss them in detail as soon as Week 3 of the lectures. So until then, thanks for your patience!

## Task 2: DOM Manipulation

In this task, you will practice manipulating the DOM using JavaScript. You will be provided with a single HTML file (`index.html`) that contains three different sections, each with its own set of requirements. Your task is to implement the JavaScript file `task2.js` and add the necessary logic to it to fulfill these requirements.

Download `index.html` file from [this link](./e2/index.html).

### 1. Add and append list item

- Write a function `addListItem` that creates a new `<li>` element with the text entered in an input field.
- When the "Add Item" button is clicked, the new `<li>` element should be appended to an existing `<ul>` list.
- If the input field is empty, the function should not add an empty `<li>` to the list.

### 2. Form validation

- Write a function `validateForm` that checks if all input fields in the form are filled.
- The form includes:
  - **Name**: A text input field.
  - **Email**: A text input field (must contain a valid email format).
  - **Password**: A password input field (minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase, one lowercase, and one digit).
  - **Repeat Password**: A password input field (must match the password field).
- If any input field is empty or invalid, display a relevant error message below the respective field. Also, make the borders of the corresponding text input red.
- If all fields are valid, display a success message below the form.
- The validation should trigger when the user clicks the "Submit" button.

### 3. Simple to-do list application

- Write a function `todoApp` that implements a simple to-do list.
- Users should be able to add items to the list using an input field and a button.
- Each item should have a checkbox to mark it as completed. Completed items should be visually distinct (e.g., strikethrough text).
- Users should be able to remove items from the list.
- The application should be initialized and handle all interactions when the page is loaded.

## Submission

- Submit your solutions as a single JavaScript file with correctly named functions corresponding to each problem. Do **not** submit the HTML file.
- Name your file `task2.js`.
- Note that, **exceptionally**, in this exercise, you will submit the files for tasks 1 and 2 separately. Submit this task's file under the corresponding task on Markus.

## Running the auto-tester:

You do not need to run the auto-tester locally. You can simply submit your code to Markus and run the tests there. However, if you do want to run them locally, follow these steps:

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) on your computer.
- Move `index.js` and `index.html` to an empty directory
- Download `e2-t2-tester.js` from [this link](./e2/e2-t2-tester.js) and move it to the same directory, next to the HTML and JS files.
- Inside that directory, run `npm init`.
- Then, run `npm install puppeteer`.
- Finally, run `node e2-t2-tester.js`.

Don't be scared of these instructions! We will discuss them in detail as soon as Week 3 of the lectures. So until then, thanks for your patience!
